## Running p5.js code locally

To run some code locally you'll need to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `http-server`, just follow these simples steps to install it:

- Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open a terminal or command prompt (on **Windows** you might need to open the command prompt as admin)
- In the terminal type:

```bash
npm install -g http-server
```

If you get a permission error on **Ubuntu** try to run the command using `sudo`. After installing the `http-server` you're ready to go!

From then on just `cd` to the folder that has the code that you want to run and type:

```bash
http-server
```

It will show you where at URL the code will be running at, then you just need to open it up in your browse:
